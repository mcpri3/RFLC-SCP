# README

This folder contains all the scripts used in the project. There are named in chronological order of use (for ex., Rcode01 is the first script to be used in the workflow). Each script contains a header explaining its function. It is mandatory to run the make.R file (in the root folder of the project) before running any script of the /analyses folder as the make.R file loads all required dependencies and functions.
