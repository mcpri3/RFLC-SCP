Description: This project provides all the data and codes used to produce the methodological framework and results presented in:
  Prima, M.-C., Renaud, J., Witté, I., Suarez, L., Rouveyrol, P., Fernando, M., Sacchi, A., Cosentino, F., Santini, L., Maiorano, L., Moreira, F., Dertien, J., Fernández, N., & 
  Thuiller, W. (in prep.). A comprehensive framework to assess landscape connectivity for conservation planning. 
  The workflow is as follow, 
  Step 1. Clustering species in functional groups having similar traits and environmental niches (analyses/Rcode01_GetFunctionalGroups.R).
  Step 2. Generating resistance and habitat suitability maps for each group based on an ensemble of species distribution models  (analyses/Rcode2_GetResisSuitMaps.R).
  Step 3. Generating ecological continuities per group (analyses/Rcode3_GetEcologicalContinuities.R).
  Step 4. Calculating multi-scale network metrics (analyses/Rcode4_GetConnectivityMetrics.R).
  Step 5. (optional) Plot figures (analyses/Rcode5_GetFigures.R).
  First run the make.R file before any run of R scripts.
  R functions are located in the R/ folder and are automatically loaded when the make.R file is run.
  Function help can be found by running the classic linecode help('function_name'). 
  Initial and intermediate datasets are located is the data/ folder (to be downloaded and added to the project, see the Readme file)
  Generated outputs are located in the outputs/ folder (to be downloaded and added to the project, see the Readme file).
